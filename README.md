# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to perform a database analysis for Pewlett Hackard. The analysis will include information on the number of future retirees from every department which will be used to prepare when to plan for future hiring events. This information will also be used to prepare a mentorship initiative.

## Results

The analysis was to find and count how many employees are at the retirement age. After conducting the analysis we can conclude that:

- There are 90,398 employees that are at the retiring age.
- Within that number there are about 65% of the retiring group hold higher positions (titles of Senior Engineer and Senior Staff) members. The deparment that will be doing the most hiring will be Engineering for the Senior Engineer position that will have to hire over 11,000 employees. 

The summary is displayed below:

## Mentorship Eligibility

For this analysis the purpose was the see how many junior employees are eligiible to be mentored to a senior position. the analysis showed that:

- about 15,000 employees are eligible for the program. This number is drastically smaller then the number of retirees but this will allow for some of the vital management positions to get filled rather than external hiring and have to pay the cost for that type of training. 

- The department that has the highest number for eligibility is the Engineering department which I believe has manager positions also availible, which consequently will cut down the cost of external hiring.

Below is the Eligibility table:

### Summary

Pewlett Hackardis preparing for 64% employees to retire or be redirected to their mentorship initiative. This will mean that they are likely going to need an extensive hiring process in the upcoming years. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a capacitation buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company in the years to come.
